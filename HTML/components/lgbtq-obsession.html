      <h1 class="title">Ron’s LGBTQ Obsession</h1>
      <cite>“They’re now using intimidation and threats of misdemeanor charges to scare LGBTQ-friendly cities out of hosting drag altogether.” </cite>
      <h2><strong>-- Former State Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith</strong></h2>
      <p>On April 12, 2023, the statewide LGBTQ rights organization Equality Florida took the extraordinary step of issuing <a href="https://eqfl.org/florida-travel-advisory"> an advisory</a> urging </a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/04/12/florida-travel-warning-lgbtq-immigration/"> caution</a> before traveling or relocating to DeSantistan.</a></p>
      <cite>“As an organization that has spent decades working to improve Florida’s reputation as a welcoming and inclusive place to live work and visit, it is with great sadness that we must respond to those asking if it is safe to travel to Florida or remain in the state as the laws strip away basic rights and freedoms,” said Nadine Smith, Equality Florida Executive Director. <br>“While losing conferences, and top students who have written off Florida threatens lasting damage to our state, it is most heartbreaking to hear <a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/02/queer-florida-parents-leaving-state-dont-say-gay/"> from parents</a> who are selling their homes and moving because school censorship, book bans and health care restrictions have made their home state less safe for their children. We understand everyone must weigh the risks and decide what is best for their safety, but whether you stay away, leave or remain we ask that you join us in countering these relentless attacks. </a></cite>
      <p>Instead of addressing Florida’s multitude of serious problems, Little Dic Ron spends a disproportionate amount of his time <a href="https://www.advocate.com/news/florida-anti-lgbtq-bills-2023"> harassing and scapegoating LGBTQ youth and drag queens. </a></p>
      <cite>“They’re now using intimidation and threats of misdemeanor charges to scare LGBTQ-friendly cities out of hosting drag altogether,” wrote former Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith on Twitter.</cite>
      <p>DeSantis piously frames his anti-LGBTQ attacks as efforts to protect Florida’s children. In fact, there is an unconstitutional piece of legislation to <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2023/04/05/could-florida-curb-parades-with-drag-performers-heres-what-a-new-bill-proposes/"> crack down</a> on gay pride parades named the “Protection of Children Bill”. However, the governor’s reprehensible record on children’s safety tells a radically different story. <br><br>The Department of Children and Families, which was created to help youth that have suffered abuse, abandonment, or neglect, reports “unacceptably high vacancy rates” and surging numbers of investigators leaving the job. <br><br>Between June 2019 and June 2022, the vacancy rate for child protective investigators (CPIs) jumped from 6.6% to 21%. During the same time-period, the turnover rate for CPIs swelled to a whopping 71% from 45%. And at the end of the 2022 fiscal year, more than half of CPI workers had less than two years of experience. </a><a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/florida-news/"> The Sun-Sentinel</a> reports:</a></p>
      <cite>“The high vacancy rate has a negative impact on staff morale and overall well-being due to increased overtime and excessive work hours,” read a section of the budget recommendation. “This can be seen in exit survey results where the top reasons for dissatisfaction among these critical classes are work/life balance, volume of work, scheduling, and salary.” As of July, the base pay for investigators was $39,600.</cite>
      <p>DeSantis seems to have unlimited state funds to fight culture war lawsuits, but habitually shortchanges the investigators charged with helping youth in crisis. The mind-blowing hypocrisy of DeSantis’ “protect the children” racket was laid bare by a <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/12/22/desantis-lawsuits-fees-attorneys-laxalt-cooper-grayrobinson/"> Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald review</a> of state financial transactions: </a></p>
      <cite>As Gov. Ron DeSantis has waged an aggressive war on what he considers “woke” culture, his ideas have come under fierce legal fire, with more than 15 lawsuits challenging his policies.<br>Four private law firms — each with deep connections to Republican Party politics — have been hired to defend the state, and the cost to Florida taxpayers is at least $16.7 million</cite>
      <p>Additionally, the GOP’s “lemming legislature” is poised to spend an outrageous sum of $107 million in public funds to hand DeSantis his own private army, that only answers to him. DeSantis has also <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/"> squandered</a> $1.5 million on a digital driver’s license app that virtually no one is using or even heard of.  <br><br>Instead of saving children’s lives, Little Dic Ron is funneling taxpayer money to rich lawyers and worthless vanity projects to boost his standing with social conservatives. His selfish desire to become president has taken precedence over keeping Florida’s mistreated youth safe and secure. That’s all one needs to know about the broken moral compass of an ethically challenged governor who has cynically elevated his career over Florida’s children. <br><br>The governor’s homophobic efforts began in earnest with Florida’s odious Don’t Say Gay law (aka Parental Rights in Education Act). His staff falsely accused those opposed to his state-sponsored persecution of “grooming” children – a disgusting blood-libel designed to smear LGBTQ people and stir up hatred by insinuating that LGBTQ adults recruit children. <br><br>The original Don’t Say Gay law prohibited instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten to third grade – although no such instruction existed. The real goal was to keep LGBTQ teachers in the closet, as well as humiliate schoolchildren with gay parents, by intimidating them into not to discussing their own families in class. <br><br>DeSantis deliberately conflates “sexualizing” with mere inclusion, to purge LGBTQ people from appearing in textbooks. Although, including the existence of gay parents in classroom instruction is no more inherently sexual than including heterosexual parents.  <br><br>DeSantis lied when he said his law was designed to protect young children from being prematurely sexualized. If this were the case, DeSantis would not </a><a href="https://apnews.com/article/dont-say-gay-desantis-florida-gender-d3a9c91f4b5383a5bf6df6f7d8ff65b6"> have expanded</a> his “Don’t Say Gay” law to cover students through their senior year of high school, who are at an age where they are mature enough to handle conversations about sexual orientation and gender identity. <br><br>Clearly, this isn’t about protecting kids, but has everything to do with encouraging bullying in schools, promoting anti-gay stigma and erasing the existence of LGBTQ people from public life. In doing so, Little Dic Ron is illegally indoctrinating students by imposing his fundamentalist religious worldview in taxpayer-funded schools. Other than backdoor proselyting and imposing his religious views on all Floridians there is no justifiable or coherent reason for these bigoted laws. They do nothing to further learning, enhance education or create better citizens.   <br><br>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre condemned the revised ‘Don’t Say Gay” law, “It’s wrong, it’s completely, utterly wrong.” She called it “part of a disturbing and dangerous trend that we’re seeing across the nation” of targeting LGBTQ people. President Joe Biden called DeSantis’ actions “hateful.” <br><br>The New Republic </a><a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/171638/floridas-anti-drag-bill-extreme-ban-rocky-horror-picture-show-hair-musical"> wrote,</a> the bill is so vaguely worded, using the term “adult live performance,” that even Republican lawmakers have admitted it would prevent a high school kid from watching The Rocky Horror Picture Show or even the musical Hair.<br><br>In protest of the Don’t Say Gay expansion, Equality Florida and the Social Equity through Education Alliance supported a coordinated </a><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3939606-advocates-plan-for-battle-as-desantis-preps-dont-say-gay-expansion/"> student-led walkout</a> at more than 300 high schools and colleges across the state.<br><br>While DeSantis likes to portray his law as promoting morality, a key Republican sponsor of the “Don’t Say Gay” law, former state Rep. Joseph Harding, </a><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/joseph-harding-dont-say-gay-sponsor-pleads-guilty-covid-relief-fraud-1234701402/"> pleaded guilty</a> to wire fraud, money laundering, and making false statements in connection with Covid relief fraud. According to Rolling Stone: </a></p>
      <cite>Harding illegally obtained more than $150,000 in pandemic loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) by lying on an Economic Injury Disaster Loan for one of his dormant business entities, per the department. Prosecutors stated that the former Florida lawmaker conducted three monetary transactions, each involving more than $10,000 in fraudulently obtained funds: a transfer to his joint bank account, a payment to his credit card, and a transfer into a bank account of a third-party business entity. He faces up to 35 years in prison.</cite>
      <p>Maybe Little Dic Ron should spend more time overseeing Republican con artists than attacking LGBTQ students and teachers? His creepy fixation on LGBTQ youth has clearly affected his job performance and caused him to miss endemic corruption occurring right under his nose amongst his closest legislative allies.  <br><br>Little Dic Ron has also spent a great deal of time working to ban drag shows -- an innocuous art form long enjoyed by the American people, including conservatives such as Donald Trump, George Santos and Rudy Giuliani. <br><br>It’s hypocritical and politically opportunistic for Republicans--who regularly take their children to Hooters after church services and have their kids order wings off the children’s menu—to suddenly mischaracterize drag shows as sexually provocative. It’s peculiar that while most Floridians are laughing at drag shows, DeSantis and his prurient supporters are lusting. Their sick, perverted minds conjure imaginary sexual acts where none exist. There are qualified psychiatrists who can help them overcome these issues. <br><br>Of course, what they really object to, and find so threatening, is that drag queens teach tolerance at a time when DeSantis is preaching hate and division. Their lessons of kindness, inclusion and love, vividly contrast with the nastiness and prejudice that Republicans are spreading throughout Florida. <br><br>While Little Dic Ron is taking <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/desantis-attempts-revoke-miami-hotels-liquor-license-drag-show-rcna75077"> autocratic actions</a> to silence drag queens, the governor is allowing actual Nazis </a><a href="https://waynebesen.substack.com/p/gov-ron-desantis-puts-out-the-welcome"> to run wild</a> in Florida. That tells one all they need to know about the real values of Ron DeSantis.  <br><br>Finally, DeSantis is waging war against transgender Floridians. Like Soviet Stalin–the governor </a><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/18/desantis-trans-health-care-florida-universities-00078435"> demanded a trove</a> of private information from 12 state universities about their students who receive gender-affirming treatments.</a></p>
      <cite> “Our office has learned that several state universities provide services to persons suffering from gender dysphoria. On behalf of the Governor, I hereby request that you respond to the enclosed inquiries related to such services,” wrote Chris Spencer, director of the Office of Policy and Budget for DeSantis, in a Jan. 11 memo to Florida Universities.</cite>
      <p>The students targeted for abuse by Little Dic Ron have a legitimate medical diagnosis known as gender dysphoria. It refers to a condition where a person has the body of one sex and brain characteristics of the other. The condition often causes acute feelings of discomfort or distress. The answer to this problem often involves approved medical treatments to align the brain with the body. <br><br>These services are medically necessary and approved by The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association. Devoid of science to back their lies about transgender Floridians, DeSantis and his puppets have turned to blatantly distorting the work of legitimate researchers and <a href="https://eqfl.org/Fine-Lies-Research"> twisting their findings</a> to fit their agenda. According to Equality Florida:</a></p>
      <cite>DeSantis' allies in the legislature are demonstrating the depths to which they will sink in service to the governor's right-wing agenda and, by extension, his desperation to be President. The Trans Ban sponsors got caught lying about data they have warped in an effort to rationalize their cruelty. And transgender Floridians are paying the price.</cite>
      <p>In March 2023, Little Dic Ron gave <a href="https://wusfnews.wusf.usf.edu/politics-issues/2023-03-08/desantis-speech-highlights-a-ban-on-transgender-surgery-for-minors"> a speech</a> where he threatened to use Big Brother state intervention to come between transgender people and their medical treatment. While this issue is controversial, decisions are best handled between a patient, their family and a doctor. There is no place for busybody Ron to stick his prying nose into private family affairs, play doctor and co-parent against the will of Florida families.  <br><br>It is an outrageous abuse of power for the unqualified DeSantis to unilaterally override the best advice on treatment from medical associations to fulfill his political ambitions. This issue is about individual liberty and whether grandstanding politicians can be constrained from intruding upon our lives with the invasive stick of Big Government. <br><br>If Little Dic Ron can arrogantly deny medical treatments for transgender people today, what’s to stop him from choosing your medication and access to medical services tomorrow?<br><br>Freedom in Florida means freedom for everyone – not just those favored by an overreaching tyrant who wantonly abuses the state’s resources to attack and punish Floridians that he doesn’t like.  </a></p>
