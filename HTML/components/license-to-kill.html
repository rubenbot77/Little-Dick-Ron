      <cite> “Florida doing away with concealed carry licensing requirements, that eliminates the mandatory gun safety course, which means even more knuckleheads will accidently shoot themselves or family members or unlucky passersby.” </cite>
      <h2><strong>-- Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel columnist Fred Grimm</strong></h2>
      <p>Thanks to the dangerous policies of Gov. DeSantis, what were once routine disagreements among citizens <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2023/03/25/a-woman-pulled-a-gun-in-a-dispute-over-a-fort-lauderdale-beach-parking-space-now-shes-saying-she-was-standing-her-ground/"> over parking spaces,</a> now degenerate from words to wielding weapons. Florida’s famous Spring Break has gone from </a><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/20/florida-spring-break-shooter-fired-stolen-gun-11-times-cops/"> fun to fatal,</a> with gunshots piercing the dance music enjoyed by visitors. </a><a href="https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2023/03/23/student-found-with-weapon-at-seminole-high-school/"> Schools are</a> also no longer gun-free, with students smuggling the state’s glut of guns into classrooms. <br><br>In this pathological environment, no one is safe from ruinous gun violence, and everyone’s family is at the mercy of armed hotheads who brandish firearms to get their way. In  Pinellas County an aggressive homeowner threatened black landscapers while </a><a href="https://www.orlandoweekly.com/news/florida-man-has-guns-seized-after-threatening-black-landscapers-with-rifle-32155679"> brandishing</a> a deadly firearm. This is the new face of Florida and how disagreements are now settled in the unhinged Kingdom of DeSantistan<br><br>VIDEO: </a><a href="VIDEO: https://www.cltampa.com/news/video-shows-tampa-bay-man-pulling-an-ar-style-gun-on-black-landscapers-13761432"> https://www.cltampa.com/news/video-shows-tampa-bay-man-pulling-an-ar-style-gun-on-black-landscapers-13761432</a></a></p>
      <p>More than two and a half million Floridians already have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, according to the Florida Department of Agriculture. Unfortunately, the dire situation in Florida is about to get much worse. The Florida House just passed the “Bad Guys with Guns Act”, that would eliminate concealed weapons permits, allowing gun owners to carry firearms in the state without the previously required license and training. <br><br>Why is Governor DeSantis and his GOP minions trying to funnel firearms to bad guys with nefarious intentions? Why is he making it easier for criminals and crackpots to assault our families with hidden weapons?  <br><br>Little Dic Ron is transforming Florida into the Wild West. He is recklessly handing out guns like they are candy in Pez dispensers. Republicans like to say they support “good guys with guns”. But in Florida, Gov. DeSantis and his rubber stamp legislative lapdogs are removing common-sense guardrails that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and violent thugs. DeSantis is essentially offering Floridians a “license to kill” each other.  <br><br>"I just don't feel that's a very responsible thing to do because training and safety should be No. 1 with all responsible gun owners," <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/permitless-carry-is-one-step-closer-to-becoming-law-in-florida/3001156/"> said Rep. Christine Hunschofsky,</a> a Democrat from Parkland who was the mayor of the city when 17 people were killed in the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School nearly five years ago.<br><br>“Untrained carry is what it is,” Hunschofsky added. “You are not making our communities, our schools or any places safer with this.”<br><br>U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat from Broward County who previously served as a Parkland city commissioner and state representative, also </a><a href="https://twitter.com/RepMoskowitz/status/1620173914591870976"> spoke out against the measure,</a> saying it "proposes more guns as a solution to a problem that didn’t exist."<br><br>Gov. DeSantis deranged gun policies have led directly to the state’s airports no longer being safe. The Transportation Security Administration </a><a href="https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/local/volusia/2023/02/28/tsa-florida-airports-seize-record-number-of-guns-from-passengers-tsa-precheck-could-be-revoked/69941588007/"> reported that</a> a record number of guns were intercepted at airport checkpoints in Florida last year. Statewide, 854 weapons were intercepted — a 28% jump from “any previous year and includes records set at 14 individual airports,” the TSA said in a press release. How many guns weren’t detected and slipped through security – with armed lowlifes and lunatics sitting next to your children on commercial flights? <br><br>Researchers with the </a><a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/research-and-practice/center-for-gun-violence-solutions/news-events"> Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions</a> found that assaults with firearms increased an average of 9.5% in states that relaxed concealed carry restrictions. Police-involved shootings jumped 12.9%. Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel columnist Fred Grimm </a><a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2023/03/17/florida-too-crowded-more-guns-and-stupidity-will-help-fred-grimm/"> points out:</a></a></p>
      <cite>If Florida does away with <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/florida-news/"> concealed carry licensing requirements,</a> that eliminates the </a><a href="https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/firearm-safety-training-requirements.html"> mandatory gun safety course,</a> which means even more knuckleheads will </a><a href="https://efsgv.org/learn/type-of-gun-violence/unintentional-shootings/"> accidently shoot</a> themselves or family members or unlucky passersby.</a></cite>
      <p>Little Dic Ron would argue that his “Bad Guys with Guns” concealed carry law would not directly put weapons into the hands of criminals. But this disingenuous argument ignores the hard truth: If you flood the community with weapons and no restraints, they inventively find their way into the hands of crooks and crazies. There is also the problem of children accidentally finding loose guns. A 3-year old boy in DeLand, Florida shot and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/3-year-old-kills-self-father-gun-florida-corrections-officer/"> killed himself</a> after finding a gun in his parents’ bedroom. <br><br>A report from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives </a><a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/atf-report-on-legal-guns-getting-into-the-wrong-hands-raise-concerns-over-florida-constitutional-carry-bill"> found that</a> 54% of guns recovered at crime scenes in 2021 were legally purchased over a three-year period. The agency found the spike could be caused by illegal gun trafficking, or guns being legally purchased before being sold to someone who can't own them. The ATF determined more than 1 million guns were stolen between 2017 and 2021, almost all of which were taken from private gun owners.<br><br>Gov. DeSantis doesn’t care about you or your family. His dumb, toxic policies will lead to the deaths of more Floridians and he’s okay with that. To highlight Florida’s morbid death toll from firearms, Moms Demand Action went to the Florida Capitol and laid out 2,849 white roses — one for each person killed by gunfire in the state last year. Thanks to Little Dic’ Ron, we can expect Florida’s white rose industry to prosper in the coming years. </a></p>
