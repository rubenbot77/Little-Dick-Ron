      <h1>Destroying Democracy</h1>
      <cite> “There is no room for dissent. Not in local governments, not in businesses, not in schools. Autocrat.”</cite>
      <h2><strong>-- Florida State Sen. Lori Berman</strong></h2>
      <p>Little Dic Ron is shorthand for Little Dictator. We have given Florida the moniker “DeSantistan” to highlight how Ron DeSantis mistakenly believes the Sunshine State is his private fiefdom. He acts as though DeSantistan is separate from the rest of America and doesn’t have to follow the United States Constitution. He’s wrong. <br><br>Ron DeSantis has repeatedly demonstrated a disdain for democracy. Florida State Sen. Lori Berman articulated this when she pointed out that in DeSantistan, “There is no room for dissent. Not in local governments, not in businesses, not in schools. Autocrat." U.S. District Judge Mark Walker echoed this sentiment, halting DeSantis’ signature policy, the “Stop-WOKE” Act, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/17/florida-anti-woke-law-block-colleges-education-00069252"> calling it</a> “positively dystopian.”  <br><br>A defining moment illustrating Ron DeSantis’ totalitarian worldview occurred at a 2022 graduation ceremony at Pine View School in Osprey, Florida. Zander Moricz, the class president, planned to give a graduation speech discussing life as a gay student. Due to DeSantis’ noxious new “Don’t Say Gay” law, Moricz was censored and stripped of his free speech rights. Moricz </a><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/25/us/florida-curly-hair-graduation-speech/index.html"> told CNN</a> that prior to graduation, the school’s principal met with him and forbade him from talking about LGBTQ issues from the podium. </a></p>
      <cite>“He’d always been very supportive of me and my identity and I was really hurt,” the class president said. “When you take that only guaranteed space and you make it one that victimizes an entire population of students, what you’re doing is you’re forcing kids to make the choice of either not come out safely or not come out at all.” </cite>
      <p>Moricz would not be silenced. He <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/25/us/florida-curly-hair-graduation-speech/index.html"> sidestepped</a> this authoritarian order by cleverly substituting his “curly hair” for his sexual orientation. Since when do Americans have to euphemistically speak in code to speak their minds? Where did Moricz graduate from, North Korea High? Right wing conservatives in Florida love to prattle about “freedom”, but this sounds more like textbook fascism. <br><br>In DeSantistan, free speech has increasingly been replaced by state speech, with Big Brother trying to control how you think and what you can say. Little Dic Ron has grown too big for his breeches, acting like a king and treating Florida citizens like subjects that must obey his unamerican commands. <br><br>Ron DeSantis portrays his 2022 reelection as a triumph. However, his victory was marred by credible allegations of voter manipulation. Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist who lives in Florida, points out that DeSantis leveraged his power to enact voter suppression measures, creating a </a><a href="https://policingequity.org/newsroom/official-statements/statement-on-ron-desantis-egregious-voter-suppression-tactics-ahead-of-november-midterm-elections"> climate of fear</a> that kept many Democrats from heading to the polls.  </a></p>
      <cite>“He gamed the system and turned Florida into an unlevel playing field,” Navarro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeVsVooldQU&amp;ab_channel=EmolumentsClause"> said on CNN.</a>  “They changed the election laws, making it harder to vote by mail. They </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/12/florida-police-man-arrest-voter-fraud-body-camera"> paraded</a> a bunch of…black people that they </a><a href="https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/florida-voting-arrest-videos-desantis-20221020.html"> arrested</a> for voting fraud in front of national media. He created an </a><a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/florida-playbook/2023/01/30/how-desantis-election-police-spent-their-first-year-00080098"> election police</a>…turnout was 10 points lower than it was in 2018. What you had was a depressed, deflated vote.”</a></cite>
      <p>Additionally, DeSantis vowed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/08/justice-department-monitors-florida-desantis/"> to block</a> Department of Justice election monitors from gaining access to polling places in South Florida. This looks suspicious, to put it mildly. It appears to be a redux of the 1960’s, when southern governors engaged in civil rights violations and voter suppression, while obstructing the federal government from acting against their illegal activity. What exactly is Ron DeSantis hiding that he didn’t want the rest of the nation to see?<br><br>There is obviously a clear conflict of interest when a sitting governor, up for reelection, unilaterally decides that only his handpicked state election monitors can keep watch over Democratic-leaning counties. Does it not seem a bit fishy that DeSantis was reelected in a landslide, but only won his first gubernatorial contest in 2018, against Andrew Gillum, by 0.4-percent? <br><br>We are not saying that Little Dic Ron didn’t win, but his police state tactics clearly ran up the numbers, giving the impression that he is more formidable than he really is.<br><br>In a foreshadowing of his fascism, the “lemming legislature” is poised to allocate $107 million in taxpayer money to give DeSantis his own private militia. Palm Beach Post columnist Frank Cerabino condemned the governor’s new army as “unnecessary”, dictatorial and a waste of public money:</a></p>
      <cite>Apparently, there is no limit to how big you can look by augmenting the heels of your high-heeled boots. So, DeSantis is elevating his stature by creating his own goon squad of 1500 toy soldiers to generate future staged campaign events, photo ops and quasi-military missions he can parlay into free airtime on FOX News. <br>DeSantis wanted a unit that he alone would control, one that had no federal component…It would be DeSantis’ own civilian Army that he could dispatch to the kind of “emergencies” his yet-to-be-announced presidential campaign would require. </cite>
      <p>State Senator Annette Taddeo alleged that DeSantis was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/desantis-proposes-reinstating-civilian-florida-military-unit"> establishing a "vigilante militia"</a> under his command. Former governor Charlie Crist said Little Dic Ron was trying to create a "handpicked secret police."<br><br>DeSantis creating a private militia with our tax dollars is even more ominous when one considers the governor’s hostility to protesters. In 2021, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker </a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/09/09/florida-judge-blocks-enforcement-anti-riot-law-backed-by-desantis/"> blocked enforcement</a> of a repressive DeSantis-backed anti-riot law. The racially-tinged legislation was passed in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter demonstrations that followed the murder of George Floyd in 2020 by Minneapolis police officers. <br><br>Slate </a><a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/04/drivers-hit-protesters-laws-florida-oklahoma-republicans.html"> wrote about</a> the draconian law, including a hair-raising provision that appeared to encourage right wing drivers to run over protesters: </a></p>
      <cite>A public gathering of three or more people can be classified as a “riot” under the law, and anyone who “willingly” participates in such a gathering can be charged with a third-degree felony. <br>Plus, participants in rallies that turn violent can also be charged with a third-degree felony even if they had no involvement with the violence. <br>Most jarring of all, the law grants civil immunity to drivers who ram into protesting crowds and even injure or kill participants, if they claim the protests made them concerned for their own well-being in the moment.</cite>
      <p>Alex Pareene <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162163/republicans-anti-riot-laws-cars"> wrote in the</a> New Republic that [such laws] create a sort of Second Amendment for cars in order to intimidate and discourage Americans exercising their rights to protest on the streets.<br><br>Judge Walker wisely ruled that the legislation was too vague, and DeSantis’ “new definition of a riot” is overbroad and criminalizes “vast swaths of core First Amendment speech…their speech continues to be chilled”. The ACLU called it “a major victory for civil rights and racial justice advocates.”<br><br>When not stripping away fundamental rights from peaceful protesters, Little Dic Ron is a thin-skinned snowflake who tries to deny non-conservative media outlets access to his administration. </a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/03/28/desantis-weak-stumbles/"> Washington Post</a> columnist Jennifer Rubin wrote about DeSantis’ disdain for the free press: </a></p>
      <cite>Until the past few weeks, DeSantis managed to hide at will from the media. Infamous for <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/political/wptv-other-news-media-not-allowed-inside-desantis-event"> locking</a> the press out, </a><a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/03/16/desantis-signs-bill-to-shield-disclosure-of-university-presidential-candidates/"> denying access</a> to state decision-making and </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/us/politics/desantis-travel-records-florida-republicans.html"> concealing information,</a> he now finds himself ill-prepared for a national media that he cannot shunt aside.<br>When he tries to avoid journalists, he looks </a><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ron-desantis-book-tour-looks-like-amateur-hour"> bumbling,</a> weak and </a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/14/trump-desantis-2024/"> scripted.</a> When he engages with </a><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3915635-desantis-clarifies-ukraine-comments-no-sufficient-interest-for-us-to-escalate-involvement/"> friendly interviewers,</a> he fumbles outside his comfort zone. It’s one thing to rail about the “liberal media” in the abstract or propose </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/10/us/politics/ron-desantis-news-media.html"> changing defamation law</a> so the media cannot report on him; it’s quite another to have to face journalists on a daily basis.</a></cite>
      <p>DeSantis has nurtured an anti-democratic culture in Florida Republican politics. It has become so extreme, that some GOP lawmakers are introducing whacky measures that go beyond what even the governor is willing to support. Republican Florida Sen. Jason Brodeur, for example, introduced a bill in the Florida Senate that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/desantis-blogger-registration-media-republican-florida-07f3fa45848f351a0b2696455d0c4372"> would require</a> bloggers to register with the state and submit periodic reports. According to the Associated Press: </a></p>
      <cite>The bill states that bloggers would have to disclose who paid them and how much, along with other information such as where the post is located online. They would be fined $25 per each day the report is late, up to a maximum of $2,500 for each report.</cite>
      <p>Little Dic Ron’s flirtation with fascism has created fertile ground for extremism to flourish, leading to a radical race to the bottom for Republican lawmakers competing to see who can introduce the most authoritarian legislation. For instance, a Republican ally of Gov. Ron DeSantis introduced an Orwellian bill to outlaw the Democratic Party. <br><br>WPTV in West Palm Beach reports that State Sen. Blaise Ingoglia filed the “Ultimate Cancel Act”. This bonkers bill calls on the state to cancel the filings of any political party that "has previously advocated for, or been in support of, slavery or involuntarily servitude." That means no more Democratic Party. When announcing the bill Ingoglia said:</p>
      <cite>"For years now, leftist activists have been trying to cancel people and companies for things they have said or done in the past. Using this standard, it would be hypocritical not to cancel the Democrat Party itself for the same reason."</cite>
      <p>It is true that the Democratic Party adopted pro-slavery positions in their party convention platforms in 1840, 1844, 1856, 1860 and 1864. But last time we checked, it’s 2023 – and times have changed. Richard Nixon embraced the Southern Strategy, with the purpose of stirring up a backlash to the civil rights movement. Nixon hoped to convince angry white southern voters to switch political parties. <br><br>The trick worked and today the Deep South has largely moved from Democratic to solidly Republican – with Florida the latest southern state to trend red.<br><br>In any case, even floating the idea of banning one’s rival Party is antithetical to democracy. It is the type of move we’d expect to see from a despot lording over a dictatorship. This legislation undoubtedly raises serious questions about Little Dic Ron’s commitment to America’s form of government. <br><br>In one of his more provocative actions, Gov. Ron DeSantis took the unprecedented step of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/us/desantis-tampa-prosecutor-abortion.html"> removing</a> twice-elected Democratic Hillsborough County prosecutor Andrew Warren.  To justify his undemocratic action, Little Dic Ron falsely claimed that Warren “undermined public safety” and been “devastating to the rule of law” because he had signed a public pledge not to prosecute those who seek or provide abortions. The New York Times reported:</a></p>
      <cite>Left unsaid, however, was that Mr. DeSantis and his advisers had failed to find a connection between Mr. Warren’s policies and public safety in his community. In fact, just the day before, writing in blue pen on a <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/de-santis-edits/d7f3b745b009404e/full.pdf"> draft of an executive order,</a> the governor had personally removed any mention of crime statistics justifying Mr. Warren’s suspension, after Mr. DeSantis’s lawyers lamented that they could find nothing in them to support the idea that Mr. Warren’s policies had done harm, according to internal documents and testimony.</a></cite>
      <p>  Further investigation by the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/11/us/politics/desantis-andrew-warren-liberal-prosecutor.html"> concluded:</a></a></p>
      <cite>A close examination of the episode, including interviews, emails, text messages and thousands of pages of government records, trial testimony, depositions and other court records, reveals a sharply different picture: a governor’s office that seemed driven by a preconceived political narrative, bent on a predetermined outcome, content with a flimsy investigation and focused on maximizing media attention for Mr. DeSantis.</cite>
      <p>Such dictatorial actions echo the governor’s autocratic moves to ban books, create a biased, right wing school curriculum, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/14/us/ron-desantis-new-college-florida.html"> purge</a> university school boards, and replace respected educators with unqualified culture war cronies. DeSantis’ assault on free thinking and academic standards have </a><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/02/23/desantis-education-policies-student-protests/11329287002/"> resulted in</a> student-led protests across the state, as well as an exodus of top-notch teachers.<br><br>Little Dic’s strong arm tactics have led to comparisons with Hungarian autocrat Viktor Orban, who has undermined democracy in Europe. Evidence suggests that DeSantis studied Orban and is copying the dictator’s authoritarian playbook. Vox wrote about the </a><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/4/28/23037788/ron-desantis-florida-viktor-orban-hungary-right-authoritarian"> troubling nexus</a> between DeSantis and Orban:    </a></p>
      <cite>“About the [Florida] Don’t Say Gay law, it was in fact modeled in part on what Hungary did last summer,” Rod Dreher, a senior editor at the American Conservative magazine, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG1tEZjRvLk&amp;ab_channel=DanubeInstitute"> said during a panel interview in Budapest.</a> “I was told this by a conservative reporter who ... said he talked to the press secretary of Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, and she said, ‘Oh yeah, we were watching the Hungarians, so yay Hungary.’”<br>When I asked DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw about a possible connection, she initially denied knowing of Hungarian inspiration for Florida’s law. After I showed her the quote from Dreher, she did not respond further. Dreher did not reply to two requests for comment.<br>In this political context, any diffusion of Hungarian-style culture-war authoritarianism to the state governments is extremely disturbing — potentially accelerating a decade-plus process of </a><a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/5/22358325/study-republican-control-state-government-bad-for-democracy"> democratic decline in</a> Republican-governed states. If DeSantis is in fact creating a blueprint for American Orbánism that Republicans across the country choose to follow, the implications for American democracy could well be disastrous.   </a></cite>
      <p>We couldn’t agree more with this prescient analysis of Ron DeSantis’ frightening and calamitous worldview and collaboration with tyrants. As concerned Floridians, we are urgently warning Americans that a political beachhead must be swiftly erected to contain Little Dic Ron’s ruinous reign to Florida’s beaches. <br><br>If DeSantis’ ends up in the White House, the United States of America, as we have come to know and love, would likely meet a swift and tragic demise. Ron DeSantis is not a normal politician. He does not represent business as usual, but the unusual business of dismantling democracy and concentrating absolute power. <br><br>DeSantis is a vindictive and vile demagogue who is hellbent on recreating America in his [or Viktor Orban’s] totalitarian image. We must stand up and resoundingly defeat the aspiring dictator.  We hope you’ll join us in beating back this bully and putting a definitive end to Ron’s Reign before it’s too late.     </p>
