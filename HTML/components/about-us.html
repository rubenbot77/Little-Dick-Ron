<h1>About <strong id="Now_1">the Website</strong></h1>
<p>Little Dic Ron is a joint project created by South Florida LGBTQ advocate Wayne Besen and Andrés Echavarría Cañas, a multi-media digital creator who specializes in promoting democracy and human rights. </p>
<p>The site is dedicated to recently deceased South Florida Gay News publisher Norm Kent, whose friendship with Besen spanned three decades. Kent <a href="https://www.independentespanol.com/?utm_source=redirect">said that</a> his “biggest disappointment” about having terminal cancer was not having enough time “to sue Ron DeSantis for the drag queen stuff.” We have no doubt that Kent would have walloped Little Dic Ron in court.</p>
<p> Wayne Besen was born in Orlando, Florida in 1970. He lived in Miami as a kid and graduated from University of Florida in 1993. He recalls the Florida of his childhood as a wonderland of fun, family and natural beauty.  </p>

<p> “My earliest memories are waking up at sunrise to eat donuts with my mom and dad, then driving to Flamingo for a day of fishing. I remember how the gigantic alligators would swim right next to our tiny boat” Besen said. “Florida is a magical place with friendly, interesting folks from all walks of life. It’s critically important that we keep Florida free, loving and open to all people.”</p>
<p>The rise of a demagogue, like Gov. Ron DeSantis, isn’t new to Florida and represents an ugly strain of bigotry that periodically rears its ugly head. </p>
<p>“In the 1950s and 1960’s we had the infamous Johns Committee persecuting LGBTQ citizens, as well as the horrors of Jim Crow,” said Besen. “In the 1970’s we had homophobic Orange Juice Queen Anita Bryant and in the 1990’s we had the anti-LGBTQ hatred of Coral Ridge Ministries’ pastor D. James Kennedy. We overcame these toxic tyrants, and we will defeat the Little Dic Ron too.”</p>
<p>As a student at University of Florida, Besen, along with Carlos Muina, created Sons & Daughters of America -- a non-profit organization that produced one of the nation’s first LGBTQ positive image ad campaigns. After graduation, Besen crafted an LGBTQ campaign in South Florida. This included a billboard in Fort Lauderdale, a bus board campaign in Broward County and television and newspaper ads for local media.</p>
<p>From 1998-2003, Besen served as a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ political organization. In 2003, he wrote Anything But Straight: Unmasking the Scandals and Lies Behind the Ex-Gay Myth. In 2006, Besen founded the LGBTQ rights organization Truth Wins Out, which is based in Delray Beach.</p>
<p>Besen has appeared on leading news and political talk shows including: the NBC Nightly News, ABC World News Tonight, MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show, MSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell, CNN’s AC360, Fox’s O’Reilly Factor and The Sean Hannity Show, and Comedy Central’s The Daily Show. He has been quoted in USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Advocate, Newsweek, TIME, The Nation, The Miami Herald, The Sun Sentinel and Mother Jones. </p>
<p>“Under no circumstances will we ever surrender our beautiful state to a despicable autocrat like Ron DeSantis,” Besen said. “We are here to wrest control of our state from the forces of ignorance and intolerance. These small-minded zealots seek to transform Florida from a sophisticated international destination into a superstitious, anti-science backwater like Mississippi. That’s not going to happen on my watch.”</p>
