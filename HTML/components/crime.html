      <h1>Crime: Lawlessness and Disorder</h1>
      <cite> "The amount of cocaine coming into Central Florida over the last couple years has actually driven down the price of bulk cocaine by approximately one third."</cite>
      <h2><strong>-- Ron Stucker, Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation Director </strong></h2>
      <p>A key pillar to Ron DeSantis’ bid for the presidency is his claim to be tough on crime. But upon closer inspection his administration is a paragon of “lawlessness and disorder.” Florida is <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/crime-rate-by-state">number 3</a> in the nation for incidents of violent crime. While right wing conservative’s love to disparage Chicago and New York City as criminal havens, Florida experienced more incidents of violent crime than Illinois and New York.  <br><br>For example, in 2022, </a><a href="https://illinoisanswers.org/2023/02/23/florida-governor-ron-desantis-crime-claims-illinois-chicago-cut-police-spending-are-false/"> there were</a> 403 violent crimes reported per 100,000 people in Illinois which is less than the 484 crimes reported per 100,000 people in Florida, </a><a href="https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/county-health-rankings-model/health-factors/social-economic-factors/community-safety/violent-crime?year=2022"> according to the data.</a> In Cook County [Chicago], 620 reported violent crimes per 100,000 was less than Duval County’s (Jacksonville) 654 per 100,000 or Orange County’s (Orlando) 648 per 100,000. Given what DeSantis has done to Florida, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck should consider carrying pepper spray.<br><br>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention </a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/drug_poisoning_mortality/drug_poisoning.htm"> found that</a> Florida had the second highest number of deaths related to drug overdoses (7,231) – and was 16th in the United States for overdose deaths per capita. Until a recent bust, it appears that DeSantis had allowed Central Florida to become a drug distribution den.  FOX 35 Orlando </a><a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/orange-county-sheriff-to-hold-press-conference-on-major-central-florida-cocaine-drug-bust"> reported:</a></a></p>
      <cite> Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation Director Ron Stucker said 2022 marked the third-largest amount of cocaine that MBI had seized in its history. Before that, the top years were in 1991 and 1992 during the crack cocaine epidemic.<br>"The amount of cocaine coming into Central Florida over the last couple years has actually driven down the price of bulk cocaine by approximately one third," he said. “One defendant allegedly mixed the powdered cocaine with horse tranquilizer to increase its volume”.</cite>
      <p>Who was governor during “the last couple of years” when law enforcement claimed that the cocaine trade flourished in the Sunshine State? Hmm. <br><br>I suppose that DeSantis could take credit for his lax policies driving down the cost of illegal drugs. Certainly, a lot of powder was going up the noses of Americans, while the cartel operated largely unincumbered under DeSantis’ nose for much of his tenure. As the MBI pointed out, this appears to be the largest quantity of unchecked rampant drug trafficking in Florida since the early-1990’s.<br><br>In 2022, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/florida-attorney-general-law-enforcement-officials-to-announce-massive-fentanyl-bust/">said</a> a “massive, violent gang operation” had been moving “unfathomable amounts of fentanyl throughout Florida.”  The attorney general’s office said the amount of fentanyl seized, 48 pounds, was enough to kill half of the state of Florida. The drug ring was finally broken up, but as Moody pointed out, “thousands here in Florida” had already died. <br><br>The prescription drug problem under Little Dic Ron is so bad, that even the fish are high, due to contaminated water runoff. The Sun-Sentinel </a><a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/education/"> reported</a> on a study by Florida International University and the Bonefish & Tarpon Trust that found:</a></p>
      <cite>Ninety-four percent of the redfish sampled had pharmaceuticals in their systems, and 26% had concentrations in their blood that researchers consider to be “concerning.” More than 50% of the redfish sampled were contaminated with both flecainide…and the habit-forming opioid pain reliever tramadol.</cite>
      <p>whatever reason, seemed to make drug lords believe that Florida is “open for business” and uniquely hospitable for trafficking their illicit products. While a few high-profile television busts make good headlines, there is little evidence to suggest that Little Dic Ron’s Florida isn’t still one of America’s leading narcotics superhighways.<br><br>Life in Florida is also plagued by crimes of opportunity. For example, the website veterinarians.org said Florida is Number 2 in the nation <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/i-team/2022/12/09/watchdog-group-ranks-florida-no-2-in-us-for-puppy-scams-and-yes-many-ads-look-legit/"> for online</a> puppy scams. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody issued an official consumer alert, warning tourists about vacation rental swindles. </a><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/florida-warns-tourists-vacation-rental-scams"> FOX Business wrote</a> in August 2022, “Some cybersecurity experts refer to Florida as the ‘Scam Capitol of the World’”.</a></p>
      <cite>"I've heard of several incidents where the family is ready for a vacation, and they've actually flown into Miami or they've flown to Fort Lauderdale and then have actually approached the actual property. They've actually knocked on the door, and the owner has come out and said you know, I don't know anything about this," Cybersecurity expert Hiram Del Amo said. </cite>
      <p>Under DeSantis, business is booming for con artists and the state is rife with fraud. An elderly Florida couple was swindled out of $25,000 in what deputies are calling an elaborate <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/florida-couple-loses-grandparents-scam"> "Grandparents Scam."</a> A Florida school principal resigned after </a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/03/30/florida-principal-sent-elon-musk-impersonator-check-for-100000-with-schools-money-report/?sh=381733416165"> being tricked</a> into sending a check for $100,000 to a con artist posing as Elon Musk. There have been </a><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/03/28/florida-lottery-ticket-scam-prison-sentence/11555186002/"> lottery scams,</a> a preacher </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/feds-arrest-florida-pastor-son-8-million-covid-scam-rcna38754"> ripping off</a> COVID money, fraudulent job </a><a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2023/01/23/south-florida-woman-warms-of-scammers-targeting-people-looking-for-jobs/"> swindles</a> and crypto </a><a href="https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2023/03/14/crypto-coaching-romance-scheme-costs-florida-woman-20000/"> schemes.</a> The examples of Floridians being ripped off are endless and they desperately need the DeSantis administration to crack down on crooks.<br><br>Yet, while his constituents were being robbed blind, Little Dic Ron hosted an </a><a href="https://www.flgov.com/2023/03/13/governor-ron-desantis-hosts-roundtable-exposing-the-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-scam-in-higher-education/"> absurd roundtable</a> on “Exposing the Diversity Equity and Inclusion Scam in Higher Education”. That’s the “scam” DeSantis is consumed with fighting? While heartless thieves were wading through our wallets and pilfering our purses the governor was busy culture warring to become president. It’s good to know Ron DeSantis has his priorities straight. <br><br>With Ron DeSantis, politics always interferes with good policing and prosecution. When Donald Trump was indicted, DeSantis said if the former president didn’t surrender to the police in New York, he would protect him, suggesting that Florida would become a sanctuary state shielding Trump from extradition. <br><br>Talk about hypocrisy? DeSantis is the same guy who fired Hillsborough County state attorney Andrew Warren in 2020, because he had implied that he would not enforce restrictions on abortion and gender therapy. So, Warren lost his job for prosecutorial discretion, while the law is whatever DeSantis says it is? Warren responded by telling </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/ron-desantis-fired-prosecutor-andrew-warren-now-speaking-rcna76983"> NBC News:</a> </a></p>
      <cite>“This has become part of the authoritarian playbook. Where rather than solving problems, you’re fanning the flames. That’s something you’d expect to see in Russia. Not in the United States.”  </cite>
      <p>Perhaps, the most disconcerting part of DeSantis’ record is his “violence signaling”. In response to an FBI raid at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago compound, an extremist tried to breach the F.B.I.’s field office outside Cincinnati. The man was killed in a standoff with the local police. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/03/us/politics/donald-trump-nypd-arraignment-jan-6.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare"> reports</a> that investigators found social media posts he had written encouraging people to go to Mar-a-Lago and potentially murder federal agents. Apparently, DeSantis had sent the message that Florida was a safe place to commit violent crimes, even against police.</a></p>
      <cite>“I recommend going, and being Florida, I think the feds won’t break it up,” one of the messages read. “IF they do, kill them.” </cite>
      <p>Under Little Dic Ron’s so-called leadership, DeSantistan is under siege by violent criminals, white supremacists parade openly, drug lords operate with relative impunity and scam artists feather their nest eggs with money stolen from vulnerable citizens.<br><br>If Ron DeSantis considers “law and order” one of his political strengths, one can only imagine how dire his weaknesses must be.  </p>
