      <h1>Ron DeSantis: The Socialist Business Busybody </h1>
      <cite> “Our point on this is that any action…to retaliate for a position the company took, sounds not just anti-business, but it sounds anti-Florida.”</cite>
      <h2><strong>-- Bob Iger, Walt Disney World CEO</strong></h2>
      <p>Ron DeSantis won reelection by creating a straw man of socialism encroaching on Florida’s shores. But a closer look at his radical record puts the governor more in line with communist dictators such as Joseph Stalin and the late Fidel Castro. <br><br>A key pillar of authoritarian dictatorships and full-blown communist regimes is leveraging immense state pressure to interfere in private business affairs and seizing control of corporate functions in the service of advancing a leaders’ dictatorial political aims.<br><br>In the history of the United States, no leader has inserted himself more—uninvited--into businesses and board rooms than Ron DeSantis. His bellicose moves to manipulate and control Florida companies are so invasive that he’d make Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro blush.<br><br>DeSantis’ aggressive interference in Florida’s market economy, to promote his extreme right wing social agenda, is so radical that Bloomberg’s Matthew Winkler <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-02-13/guess-who-loses-after-florida-and-texas-bar-wall-street-esg-banks?srnd=premium"> explained how</a> DeSantis is costing Florida taxpayers millions of dollars in increased bond market fees. Winkler wisely observed, “If socialism means state control of production, distribution and exchange of goods and services, then Florida and Texas fit the description.”<br><br>DeSantis’ anti-corporate crusade kicked-off with a blistering attack on the state’s largest employer, Walt Disney World. The governor was angry because the company tepidly spoke out against Florida’s tyrannical “Don’t Say Gay” law.<br><br>DeSantis swiftly retaliated, along with his legislative allies in Tallahassee, by eliminating a multi-million-dollar benefit that allowed Disney to largely govern its own affairs on the amusement park’s gigantic property. [USA Today columnist Rex Huppke </a><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/02/14/ron-desantis-woke-disney-florida-ap-african-american-fake-trump-huppke/11251923002/"> exposed DeSantis’</a> capitulation to Disney, after it was clear his move would have stuck Florida taxpayers with a $1 billion tax bill] <br><br>In April 2023, Walt Disney Co. announced plans to invest $17 billion in Walt Disney World over the next decade and create 13,000 new jobs. Disney World estimates that it would host 50 million visitors in 2023 and it is the state’s largest taxpayer. It takes a special kind of buffoon to go to war with a company that means so much to the state’s identity, employment and tax base. <br><br>Asked about DeSantis’ vindictive actions, Disney </a><a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2023/04/03/iger-vows-17b-disney-world-expansion-calls-desantis-anti-business/"> CEO Bob Iger</a> said that DeSantis dissolved Reedy Creek “in effect to seek to punish a company for its exercise of a constitutional right.” Iger further elaborated: </a></p>
      <cite>“Our point on this is that any action that thwarts those efforts, simply to retaliate for a position the company took, sounds not just anti-business, but it sounds anti-Florida, and I’ll just leave it at that.”</cite>
      <p>Like a true tyrant, DeSantis <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65216192"> threatened to punish</a> Disney by promising to </a><a href="https://www.wesh.com/article/desantis-disney-takeover/43636913"> control</a> theme park rides, build a </a><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65305166">  state prison</a> adjacent to Disney property, and levy new taxes on its hotels and roads that lead to the theme park.</a></p>
      <cite>"But now that Disney has reopened this issue, we're not just going to void the development agreement they tried to do, we're going to look at things like taxes on the hotels, we're going to look at things like tolls on the roads," DeSantis said, saying the state would also look to develop property it owns near Disney.</cite>
      <p>If Little Dic Ron follows-through on his childish temper tantrum, we suggest Disney raise the price of theme park passes by $5.00 and print DESANTIS TAX in bold lettering on the front of each ticket, so people know who is responsible for the rise in prices. This would inform park-goers that DeSantis’ attacks on business operations incur a cost that must be passed on to consumers.<br><br>DeSantis’ bullying extended to other corporations and even nonprofit organizations. Little Dic was at his smallest, when he picked a fight with the Special Olympics. No, this isn’t fake news or an attempt to smear DeSantis. He actually <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2022/06/03/special-olympics-drops-covid-vaccine-mandate-after-florida-threatens-275m-fine/"> threatened to fine the Special Olympics $27.5 million</a> for requiring 5,500 participants at the USA Games in Orlando to be vaccinated against COVID. USA Today columnist Mike Freeman pointed out why this was particularly egregious:</a></p>
      <cite>The Special Olympics reported that the 2019 World Games included over <a href="https://www.specialolympics.org/stories/news/on-world-ds-day-celebrating-athletes-with-down-syndrome-who-prove-their-power-ability-through-sports"> 1,000 athletes with Down Syndrome.</a> Two years ago, a </a><a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/down-syndrome-covid-19"> large study out of the UK</a> showed that people with Down Syndrome who get COVID are four times more likely to be hospitalized, and 10 times more likely to die, than the general population. Studies since then have buttressed that research.<br>The CDC last year updated its guidelines to include people with Down Syndrome at increased risk for severe COVID disease. By requiring that Special Olympians get vaccinated, you lower the risk of them catching COVID. This is highly elementary stuff.</a></cite>
      <p>After putting Special Olympians at risk for illness and death, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/03/ron-desantis-blocks-funds-tampa-bay-rays-gun-safety"> sought revenge</a> against the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team. Following the mass shooting in Uvalde, TX that killed 19 schoolchildren, the Rays pledged $50,000 to a gun safety reform group and Tweeted:</a></p>
      <cite>“This cannot <a href="https://twitter.com/RaysBaseball/status/1529951434682339328"> be normal.</a> We cannot become numb. We cannot look the other way. We all know, if nothing changes, nothing changes.”</a></cite>
      <p>For the fatal infraction of supporting non-fetal life, DeSantis lurched off his throne to block state money for a new Tampa Bay Rays training facility. He did this only days before the six-year anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando.<br><br>DeSantis’ next dictatorial move was to go after the Orlando Philharmonic Plaza Foundation. Little Dic’ Ron threatened to pull the group’s liquor license because he personally opposed a drag show that they staged. His administration had filed a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/florida-gov-ron-desantis-files-complaint-miami-drag-show-rcna40438"> similar complaint against Miami restaurant R House,</a> citing </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/1947-florida-shut-popular-drag-club-state-resurrected-case-rcna40947"> a 1947 state Supreme Court case that found “men impersonating women”</a> in the context of “suggestive and indecent” performances constitutes a public nuisance, according to </a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/desantis-tries-revoke-orlando-philharmonics-liquor-license-drag-show-rcna69522"> NBC News.</a> <br><br>The Hyatt Regency Miami is another victim of Little Dic Ron’s commie crusade against business. The governor moved to </a><a href="https://apnews.com/article/desantis-lgbtq-drag-shows-florida-c353b4161c2bcb2770168187154797ee"> revoke</a> their liquor license for hosting a Christmas drag show. The state’s oppressive and vindictive Department of Business and Professional Regulation filed an administrative complaint that falsely alleged the performance was “sexually explicit” and that children were present for a “lewd, vulgar and indecent” display.<br><br>Ron DeSantis is so power drunk that he believes he can choose what entertainment Floridians see and what fare businesses can offer. He’s so involved with programming details of shows that maybe he should be given a director’s credit. <br><br>This arrogant tyrant also thinks he knows better than loving Florida parents which forms of entertainment are appropriate for their children. Whatever happened to Little Dic Ron’s professed support for “Parents Rights”? Perhaps he misspoke and meant that he only represents right wing parents? <br><br>Is this the “freedom” offered in Florida that is so frequently cited by DeSantis?  No wonder why Little Dic </a><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/desantis-rattles-establishment-gop-after-saying-us-interest-ukraine-russia-war-not-vital"> is soft</a> on Vladimir Putin – he thinks just like the Russian police state dictator. <br><br>The extent of Little Dic Ron’s ignorance on business issues was revealed when he blamed woke economics for the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. During a bizarre appearance on Fox News Channel’s Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo, DeSantis said, “I mean, this bank, they’re so concerned with DEI and politics and all kinds of stuff. I think that really diverted from them focusing on their core mission.”  <br><br>No individual or business is safe from targeted persecution if they run afoul of Little Dic Ron in DeSantistan. Thankfully, Mickey Mouse is in a fighting mood, according to </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/23/disney-world-lgbtq-conference-ron-desantis"> The Guardian:</a> </a></p>
      <cite>Disney is pushing back against Florida’s rightwing Republican governor Ron DeSantis’s crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights by hosting a major LGBTQ+ conference.<br>The Out & Equal Workplace summit has touted itself as the “largest LGBTQ+ conference in the world” and draws more than 5,000 attendees annually. For the next two years, the Out & Equal non-profit which focuses on LGBTQ+ workplace equality will be held at Walt Disney World in Orlando</cite>
      <p>Florida companies must follow Disney’s lead. If the business community doesn’t take a stand against Little Dic Ron’s busybody policies, DeSantistan will soon become known as hostile to market capitalism, vulnerable to consumer boycotts and the economy will markedly deteriorate as smart companies choose to avoid Florida over its Castro-like control over intimate business decisions.   </p>
